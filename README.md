## Synopsis

This project involved a pivot on a previous project (the IdeaBox). We were given another team's code base and our goals were to refactor the code base and fix any broken functionality and add any missing functionality from the original specifications. In addition, there were new pieces of functionality to be implemented.  This application allowed us to practice using jQuery and javascript for logic and DOM manipulation, and the use of JSON/LocalStorage. We also got to hone our skills in shortening our code, and finding alternative solutions to make our code more concise.  This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Usage
The application is a to-do-list, where a user can create tasks to be completed, and they will be appended to the site. Upon clicking the Save button, a new task card is generated that contains the information for the new "to-do".  One can then click various buttons to change the importance level of the task, to mark it as completed, or to remove the task from the page (and local Storage). The page shows only the ten most recent tasks upon page load, but the user has the option to view more tasks by clicking the "Show More Tasks" button and the remaining tasks will be loaded to the page. The user can also view only completed tasks by clicking on the "Show Completed Tasks" button.  There are five buttons corresponding with importance levels that will display only tasks of relevant importance. Lastly, there is a search bar available for the user to filter through various tasks.
